h2. Documentation

No real documentation right now, please see the project's README to get started.

*Please Read* Ogre.rb will not attempt to document the Ogre public API. This library assumes decent working knowledge of Ogre itself, though if you need help Ogre has a very good set of documentation available at these places:

* "Ogre Wiki":http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
* "Ogre Manual":http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/
* "Ogre API Reference":http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/

Also, if you are new to Ruby, the following sites will help out with learning the language

* "Official Ruby site":http://www.ruby-lang.org
* "Ruby Documentation":http://www.ruby-doc.org/
* "Pragmatic Programmer's Guide to Ruby":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/pickaxe/
* "_why's poignant guide to Ruby":http://poignantguide.net/ruby/ (not for the weak at heart)

h2. Building

Information on building Ogre.rb wrappers will go here. For now, see the Rakefile and the .rake files in the various wrappers.

h2. Running

Please see the programs in the samples/ directory. These are direct ports of Ogre's samples into Ogre.rb. All the rules about running an Ogre application (resources.cfg, ogre.cfg, plugins.cfg) are true in Ogre.rb as well.
