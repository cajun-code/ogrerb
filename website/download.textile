Ogre.rb does not currently have any availble downloads, please grab code directly from the "repository on github":http://github.com/jameskilton/ogrerb.

Old versions of Ogre.rb (those using the SWIG wrappers) are available on the "Rubyforge project page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/ogrerb. That said, these releases are no longer supported.
